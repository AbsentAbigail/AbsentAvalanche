Avalanche of new and random cards and charms
Lots of sillies to play with :3

Content:
1 Tribe
15 Plushies (Most plushies are both leaders for the plushie tribe and companions)
5 Dream Teams
11 Companions (excluding plushies)
3 Pets
19 Items
11 Charms

Make sure to headpat the plushies when they do well!
If you see your leader as a companion please ignore them, the plushies get nervous seeing themselves :<
